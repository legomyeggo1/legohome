<h1>I FUCKING HATE MCDONALDS !!!!</h1><br>
i dont understand why people love mcdonalds so much<br><br>
  a. the food just straight up isn't good <br>
    go to any other fast food place (other than arby's or burger king)<br>
    do you think that that places food is worse than mcdonalds?? <br>
    didn't think so nerd <br><br>
  b. mcdonalds is a burger place<br>
    i hear what you're saying: "obviously dumbfuck"<br>
    ask anyone what their favorite item is at mcdonalds<br>
    How many times is it a burger.<br>
    says 'nuff<br>
  c. mcdonald's builds brand loyalty through parents<br>
    people who grew up with mcdonalds generally like it more <br>
    because people grew up with this place, it built a loyalty to the brand<br>
    and i'm not saying i dont have loyalty to certain brands, cause i do (and they're pretty irrational)<br>
    but because these people grew up eating mcdonald's, they associate it with happy times<br>
    and it has you going back because of those happy times.<br>
    because your parent brought you there as a child, you think in your subconcious that it's the best.<br>
  <h1>closing statements</h1><br><br>
  <h2>mcdonalds has built their entire brand on manipulation and loyalty</h2><br>
  people who say mcdonald's is the best fast food place are objectively wrong. <br>
  have these people seriously tried In-N-Out, Whataburger, or Jack in the Box and said it was worse than McDonalds??<br>
  i'm seriously done having this argument with people, and i just have to express this<br>
