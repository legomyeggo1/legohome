<h3>ramblings of a madman: entry 1</h3> 
<h1>I FUCKING HATE MCDONALDS !!!!</h1><br>
i dont understand why people love mcdonalds so much<br><br>
  a. the food just straight up isn't special / amazing <br>
    go to any other fast food place (other than arby's or burger king)<br>
    do you think that that places food is worse than mcdonalds?? <br>
    mc donald's food is basically a baseline for all fast food, and the food itself is C teir at best. <br>
    and their food has changed so many times it's not as good as it used to be. <br><br>
  b. mcdonalds is a burger place<br>
    i hear what you're saying: "obviously dumbfuck"<br>
    ask anyone what their favorite item is at mcdonalds<br>
    How many times is it a burger.<br>
    I think mcdonalds should actually focus on making their burgers as good as their other items.<br><br>
  c. mcdonald's builds brand loyalty through parents<br>
    people who grew up with mcdonalds generally like it more <br>
    feed a chicken nugget to a person who didn't grow up eating them, and i'll bet it's the weirdest thing they've had up until that point<br>
    and i'm not saying i dont have loyalty to certain brands, cause i do (and they're pretty irrational)<br>
    but because these people grew up eating mcdonald's, they associate it with their childhood<br>
    and it has you going back because of rose tinted glasses.<br>
    nostalgia's a powerful thing, and mcdonalds profits off of it.<br>
  <h1>closing statements</h1><br><br>
  <h2>mcdonalds has built their entire brand on loyalty and nostalgia</h2><br>
  people who say mcdonald's is the best fast food place are objectively wrong. <br>
  have these people seriously tried In-N-Out, Whataburger, or Jack in the Box and said it was worse than McDonalds??<br>
  this is a fucking dumbass argument that i'm done having<br>
